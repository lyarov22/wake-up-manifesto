## Time won’t wait. Break or be broken.

1. **Chapter 1: No one knows what to do — and that's okay**
    - Meaning, fear, false goals, the cult of success.
    
2. **Chapter 2: Time is currency. And you've wasted it**
    - About how days turn into nothing if you don't take action.
    
3. **Chapter 3: Judgment, hate, other people's opinions — throw them all away**
    - About the cockroaches in the heads of those around you.
    
4. **Chapter 4: Laziness is your religion. How to give up your faith**
    - Practice, a kick in the pants, steps toward self-discipline.
    
5. **Chapter 5: Body, money, respect — build, don't beg**
    - About physical fitness, money, dignity. No whining.
    
6. **Chapter 6: Boldness is not a sin. It is a tool**
    - How to move forward when you are afraid. How to say “no.” How to choose your path.

7. **Chapter 7: Gratitude, not showing off**
    - About how generosity does not equal weakness. That giving is a powerful move.

8. **Chapter 8: What's next?**
	- Action plan. 30-day challenge. Mini-practices. Tables. Blank pages for the reader.
	
## **Chapter 1. No one knows what to do — and that's okay**

Look around. Look at the people around you.  
Smart, mature, successful. They tell you how to live. They teach you. They have opinions, advice, plans.  
They know everything. Right?

Bullshit.

Most of them just **pretend** they know what they're doing.  
They go with the flow, cling to stereotypes, repeat other people's behavior patterns — like parrots in suits. Some got married because it was “time.” Some work in an office because it's “stable.” Some people get drunk every Friday because **there's nothing else to fill the void**.

And you don't know what to do either.  
And that's **normal**.

### The problem is not that you are lost.

The problem is that you **think that others are not lost**.

From childhood, we are taught to “find your purpose,” “become someone,” “build a career,” and “don't disgrace yourself.”  
Question: **who said they're right?**  
Where's the guarantee that this path isn't a straight road to a dull, predictable ass?

People want certainty.  
They're afraid to admit that **life is chaos**.  
That there are no instructions. There is no final boss to defeat. There is no applause at the end.

And here you have a choice:

- Either you live **trying to please an invisible judge**,

- Or you admit: you are **in free fall**, and this is **the best thing that has ever happened to you**.
    

You don't have to know what to do.  
You have to **start moving**. Even if it's uncertain, even if it's not in the right direction — just **don't stand still**. The road won't grow under your feet if you sit on your ass and Google “what is the meaning of life.”

Meaning **comes in the process**.

---

### Important questions to ask:

- What angers me so much in this life that I can no longer remain silent?

- What do I do even when no one pays me and no one is watching?
    
- Where am I wasting time pretending to live?


---

You don't have to be sure.  
You have to **be alive**.

## **Chapter 2. Time is currency. And you wasted it.**

There is only one real resource.  
Not money. Not connections. Not genes. Not education.  
**Time.**

It's the only currency you **can't earn**, **can't save**, **can't get back**.  
And it's what you give away every day in exchange for all kinds of crap:  
– scrolling through TikTok,  
– pointless arguments,  
– toxic social circles,  
– procrastination under the guise of “I need to think,”  
– a stupid job you hate but are afraid to quit,  
– relationships that are dead but you find it easier to pretend are fine.

### The funny thing is that you don't even notice how you're paying for it.

It's as if you have unlimited resources.  
As if **there will be a later**, **there will be a tomorrow**, **there will be a better moment**.

**There won't be.**  
If you don't take yourself by the scruff of the neck, _no one_ will come to save you.  
No universe, no chance, no startup daddy or fairy godmother.

---

### Imagine:

You lose 1,440 minutes every day.  
It's like $1,440 is deposited into your account every day, but if you don't spend it, it burns up.  
**Would you sit and binge-watch TV shows for days on end?**  
No. You would think about how to invest it, how to get the most out of it.  
But over time, you don't do that. You just spend it blindly. And you don't even write down where.

>  “No time” is a lie.  
> You just don't realize **what** it's going to.

---

### Now seriously:

- How many hours a week do you **actually** work on your dream?
    
- How much time do you spend **automatically**, just because “that's the way it is”?

- How many minutes a day do you **live consciously**, without rushing around, without your mind racing?


---

### Here's the truth:

You don't control your life if you don't control **where your time goes**.

---

###  Mini-challenge at the end of the chapter:

**7 days of hardcore honesty.**

Every day for a week:

1. Set a timer (you can use your phone).
    
2. Every 30 minutes, write down what you did.

3. At the end of the day, note how many hours were wasted.

4. After a week, **face the truth**.


> _It will hurt. But that's the beginning of control._

## **Chapter 3. Condemnation, hate, other people's opinions — to hell with them**

You were taught to be “normal.”  
Don't stand out. Don't get angry. Don't be loud. Don't do anything stupid.  
**What will people say?**

Screw them.

### Who are these “people”?

– Office drones who have been living someone else's life for years.  
– Classmates whose opinions died with graduation.  
– Relatives who are afraid to live themselves, but teach you “how to do it right.”  
– Pseudo-friends who laugh when you slip up because **they are afraid that you will grow up and they won't.**

> **Judgment is the cry of the weak who cannot create, so they destroy.**

---

### Why do people judge?

Because it's easier.  
It's easier to point a finger at someone else's failure than to **get up and do something yourself.**

When you change something, you **provoke their fear**.  
You become a reminder that **it is possible to live differently**.  
And they start to defend themselves — with hate, insults, “sound advice.”  
But it's not about you. It's their inner hell.

---

### And you are afraid. Afraid to slip up, because someone will say:

– “You're not like that.”  
– “You've gone crazy.”  
– “You can't do it.”  
– “What kind of nonsense have you come up with?”  
– “You won't succeed.”

And I'll tell you this:  
**Being afraid of making a mistake means letting others write your life.**  
Do you really want the script of your life to be written by people **who don't even give a shit about themselves?**

---

###  The truth:

- All great people have failed. More than once.

- Everyone who stands out seems “strange” at first.

- And everyone who has really achieved something **stopped asking others for permission.**
    

> **You either live the way you want or the way others tell you to. You can't combine the two.**

---

### How to tune out the noise of others?

1. **Stop explaining yourself.**  
    You don't owe anyone anything. Explain yourself only to yourself.
    
2. **Check your surroundings.**
Who in your life is fuel, and who is lead on your feet?

3. **Remember one thing:**
Every time you bow to someone else's opinion, you kill a part of yourself.


---

###  Exercise:

**List of permissions to yourself.**

Take a sheet of paper.  
Write:

- “I allow myself to mess up.”

- “I allow myself to be different.”

- “I allow myself to dream out loud.”
    
- “I allow myself not to be comfortable.”

- “I allow myself to go where I want.”


Put it nearby. Repeat every day.  
Until **you give up on all those who never started living.**

## **Chapter 4. Laziness is your religion. How to give up your faith**

You pray every day. You don't even notice it.  
You have a sacred mantra:  
**“Later.”**

– I'll start on Monday.  
– Now is not the time.  
– I'm not inspired.  
– I'm not ready.  
– I need to think about it some more.

Sound familiar?

You have become a believer.  
Your religion is **laziness**.  
And you believe in it more than you believe in yourself.

---

### Laziness is not about fatigue.

Laziness is about fear.

You're afraid that it won't work out. You're afraid of wasting your energy. You're afraid that people will see you trying.  
Because **if you give it your all and fail, it will hurt**.  
But if you just stay lazy — well, you didn't even start, so you can say, “I could have, but I didn't want to.”

It's convenient.  
It's safe.  
But then **a year goes by**, then another.  
And you're still there.  
In a warm, smelly puddle of excuses.

---

##  What modern laziness looks like:

– Productive procrastination: “I'm sorting out my tasks.”  
– Substituting goals: “I'm working on myself... sometimes.”  
– The illusion of busyness: “I don't have time, I'm very busy.”  
– Justified rest: “I deserve Netflix after a hard day... in which I did nothing”

> You're not tired. You're overgrown.

---

### The main thing about laziness is that it speaks **in your voice.**

You believe it because **you think it's you.**

It's not you. It's a **virus in your head**.  
And it will consume everything if you don't turn it off.

---

###  What to do:

1. **Microsteps.**  
    If you can't do everything, do 1% of your goal.  
    One approach, one paragraph, one minute. Every day.

2. **Do it even when you don't feel like it.**  
    **Mood is not a condition.**  
    Professionals work without inspiration. They just work.

3. **Is discipline a crutch for the weak?**  
    No. It is a weapon for the strong.  
    All great people disciplined themselves to the point of pain.  
    Because without discipline, you are a puppet of your emotions, not a person.


---

###  And most importantly:

You are not special.  
Your laziness is not unique.  
You either get up and do it, or you **stay in the swamp** that you dug yourself.

> 💣 _Either you will hurt yourself with training, getting up, trying, or the pain will hurt you — slowly but surely._

---

###  Exercise:

**The 5-minute rule.**  
Right now: choose a task that you've been putting off for a long time and devote **exactly 5 minutes** to it.  
**Timer. No breaks. No excuses.**  
If you couldn't do it, write down why on a piece of paper.

**The answer will be your demon.**

## **Chapter 5. Body, money, respect — build it, don't ask for it**

Do you want to be respected?  
To be admired? To be taken seriously?

Do you want to be confident, walk with your back straight, and feel that **you are okay**?

Well, here's the thing:  
**Respect is not given. It is built.**  
On **deeds, actions, discipline**.  
Not on “I'm good, but no one notices me.”

---

### Want a body?

 Go to the gym. Not tomorrow. Today.  
Do push-ups. Run. Suffer through the pain.  
You're not a wreck. You're just **fed up with feeling sorry for yourself.**

Self-respect starts with **physical fitness**.  
Not for other people's likes.  
But for the inner feeling: **“I'm not shit, I'm in control.”**

> Either you control your body, or it controls you. There is no third option.

---

### Want money?

 Stop whining that “everything is difficult.”  
Learn. Grab knowledge. Develop skills. See where the world is going.

– The more you know, the more you are worth.  
– The more you can do, the more freedom you have.  
– The more you create, the more you get paid.

**Money is a side effect of usefulness.**  
You're not rich because **you don't do anything that's worth a lot.**

> Poverty isn't a curse. It's a temporary state.  
> But whining is a choice.

---

### Want respect?

 Stop bending over backwards.  
Stop clinging to toxic friends.  
Stop being convenient and accommodating to everyone.

**Respect starts with boundaries.**  
When you know how to say “no.”  
When you're not afraid to lose someone who doesn't appreciate you.

> **People respect not the kind, but the whole.**  
> And wholeness is when you know who you are and don't give up your position.

---

###  The main thing:

– If you want to be strong, **work out.**  
– If you want to be free, **earn money.**  
– If you want to be respected, **live by your own rules.**

**It won't just happen. It won't fall from the sky. It won't be given to you.  
It has to be BUILT. Every day. Through pain. Through action.**

---

### Exercise:

**Write three lists on a piece of paper:**

1. What can I do for my body today?

2. What skills/steps will earn me money in the next 6 months?

3. Where do I give up my boundaries, and how will I start to defend myself?


Pick one item from each list.  
**Complete them within 24 hours. No discussions. No bargaining.**

## **Chapter 6. Boldness is not a sin. It is a tool.**

Since childhood, you have been told:  
– “Be more modest.”  
– “Don't push yourself forward.”  
– “Don't be rude.”  
– “Sit quietly, and everything will be fine.”

**Bullshit.**

No one notices modest people.  
No one listens to quiet people.  
Kind people get walked all over.  
Convenient people get used.

---

You think that boldness is bad.  
But I'll tell you this:  
**Boldness is a way to survive in a world where the weak get trampled on.**

> The world won't give you a place. You have to **fight for it.**  
> No one cares about your confidence until you make yourself known.

---

### What is boldness?

It's not rudeness.  
It's not aggression.  
It's **directness, courage, and a willingness to go where it's scary.**

Boldness is when you:  
– Say “no” to toxic people  
– Ask for more  
– Keep your word  
– Defend an idea, even if everyone is against it  
– Walk away when everyone else stays  
– Go on stage when you're shaking with fear

---

### Example:

There are two types of people:

1. **The doubting shy person**  
    – “What if I'm not worthy...”  
    – “I'm not ready yet...”  
    – “I need to think it through first...”
    
2. **The bold doer**  
    – “I don't give a fuck. I'll try.”  
    – “If I screw up, at least I'll know.”  
    – “Now, not later.”


**Which of them lives a more interesting life? Which of them will achieve more?**

The answer is obvious.

---

###  But!

Boldness requires a foundation.  
– Without knowledge, you're just a clown.  
– Without working on yourself, you're a show-off.  
– Without respect for others, you're an asshole.

**True audacity is precision.**  
You don't yell — you **speak loudly.**  
You don't show off — you **show results.**

---

### 💣 Want to break out? Become uncomfortable:

– Ask uncomfortable questions  
– Demand to be treated as an equal  
– Don't adapt to other people's weaknesses  
– Don't apologize for your strength

> The world doesn't need another polite slave.  
> The world needs you — **real, direct, uncomfortable, alive.**

---

###  Exercise:

**List of audacity.**

1. Write down 3 things that you are **afraid to say to people** — but want to.

2. Write down 3 things that you **want to do but put off because of other people's opinions.**
    
3. Do at least **one** of them today.  
    No preparation. No approval. No pity.

## **Chapter 7. Gratitude, not showing off**

You went through pain, you survived, you became bold.  
What next? Flex? Prove yourself?  
Walk around like a rooster, shouting, “Look, I did it!”?

No, brother. True strength is **not in shouting, but in silence**.  
In quiet gratitude. In understanding that you are not a god, not a hero, but simply **someone who got up and went.**

---

### Showing off is a mask.

It's needed when you feel empty inside.  
When you have no stability, no peace, no sense of self.  
You flex to **fill the void with attention**.

**Gratitude is the core.**  
You are calm.  
You know how much your journey has cost you.  
You don't shout — you **radiate**.  
You share not for likes, but because **you can give**.

---

> **The stronger you are, the less you need to appear to be.**  
> Because you **already are.**

---

### Gratitude is not weakness.

It's not “thank you for the crumbs.”  
It's:  
– Thank you to yourself for not giving up.  
– Thank you to those who didn't betray you.  
– Thank you to life — even for the blows.  
– Thank you to pain — it taught you.

**It's awareness. It's maturity. It's peace in your heart, even when the world is shaking.**

---

### And now for the facts:

– Respect begins with self-respect.  
– Self-respect begins with recognizing the path you've traveled.  
– And recognizing the path is gratitude, not showing off.

**You don't have to shout about what you've achieved.**  
Just **do something good. Silently. Strongly. Like a man.**  
Support, pass on, lift someone up.

---

> 💬 “I donated 9 million” — it's not showing off if you **haven't changed your behavior**.  
> If you still sit down at the table, look people in the eye, and **don't think you're better than them**.  
> This is gratitude to the world — for becoming yourself.

---

###  Exercise:

**Practice grateful action.**

1. Find someone who's in a bad way.
    
2. Support them. With money, words, connections, advice.

3. Don't expect anything in return. Don't mention it to anyone.

4. Just do it. Just be a support. Once.


> It won't change them. It will change **you**.

---

### The strong are silent, but they act.

The weak are silent, but they rot.

**You're not there anymore.**  
You've been through the fire.  
Now your strength is **light**, not just a fist.

## **Chapter 8. What next?**

Okay.  
You read it. You felt it.  
Something clicked. Something squeezed. Something made you want to get up and smash the mirror in which someone else had been living all this time.

But there's one question:  
**What are you going to do with it now?**

---

### You can close the book.

Scroll. Eat. Sleep. Work.  
Smoothly return to your familiar rut.

### Or you can take a pause. Look inside. And say to yourself:

**“Enough. I'm different now. I'm taking action now.”**

---

### The truth is:

You already know **what you don't want**.  
You know **where you've been deceiving yourself**.  
You know **what you're capable of** — even if you haven't shown it yet.

You no longer have the right to **pretend** that everything is fine.  
Because you've seen the light.  
Because you've felt **how it can truly be.**

---

### Your task:

**Don't let yourself forget.**  
Here are 5 steps you can take today:

---

###  **Five decisions to make:**

1. **Write down who you want to be in a year.**  
    Not just “rich” or “successful.”  
    Be specific: what you wear, where you live, how you feel, what you do.

2. **Take the first step. Today.**  
    Not a big one. A small one.  
    One phone call. One approach in the gym. One refusal to take out the trash.  
    **But do it.**

3. **Remove the weak.**  
    A contact that drags you down. A habit that eats up your energy.  
    A thing that reminds you of your old self.  
    **Clear the space.**
    
4. **Choose pain.**  
    Where it's scary — go there.  
    Where it hurts — that's where growth is.  
    Where it's stuffy — that's where freshness is.  
    **Don't run away. Go towards it.**

5. **Take responsibility. For everything. **  
    Stop blaming the city, your parents, your salary, your childhood, your exes.  
    Starting today: **everything that happens is within your control.**


---

###  And finally:

If this book has resonated with you, don't write a review. Don't share it on your stories.  
**Share the results.**  
Show yourself in six months. In a year. In a lifetime.

Become someone who **cannot be ignored.**  
Become someone who **doesn't need to be explained.**

---

>  _“Either you live in a way that will be remembered, or you disappear among those who have always waited for the ‘best moment.’”_

Your moment is **right now**.  
Or **never.**

---

###  The end. But in reality — only the beginning.
